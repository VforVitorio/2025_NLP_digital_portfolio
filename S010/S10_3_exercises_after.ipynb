    "### What the Function Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `create_ner_tags` takes the text and entities and converts them into BIO format. It starts by splitting the text into words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it maps each word to a tag: \"O\" for words that are not part of an entity, \"B-\" for the first word of an entity, and \"I-\" for subsequent words inside the entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function also uses the character positions of the entities to determine which words they correspond to. Once the tags are assigned, the function returns the words and their BIO tags, ready for use in training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model."
